# Gesture_Recognizer_Plus_Computer_Control

- Developed in Python

- Used Web Camera for taking input

- A menu is also displayed in the output

- It was made as part of my 6th Semester's group project

- We also took help of some open-source algorithms and github to develop our program

- It provides multiple functionalities through the help of gestured buttons and thus functionalities can be extended further

- Accuracy may get reduced due to luminance

- Use of a better camera may increase its performance
