-A menu is also displayed in the output

-It was made as part of my 6th Semester's group project

-We also took help of some open-source algorithms and github to develop our program

-It provides multiple functionalities through the help of gestured buttons and thus functionalities can be extended further

-Accuracy may get reduced due to luminance

-Use of a better camera may increase its performance
